## Experience

### Software Engineer
Stripe, Tax Remittance
February 2022 - Present
* Full-stack engineer working in React, Typescript, Ruby, and Java codebases and Mongo, Kafka, GraphQL, and Temporal services.
* Improved development workflow by automating boilerplate code generation resulting in a 30% increase in developer productivity (Python autogenerating Typescript). 
* Leading the implementation of service resilience practices, which include gameday exercises, load testing, and chaos engineering. This work will improve onboarding, overall team incident response, and early detection of load vulnerabilities and sharp edges.

### Assistant Director, Advanced Computing Lab
Dartmouth College
April 2019 - February 2022
- Led and deployed secure computing environment which will reduce time-to-science from months to less than a week.
- Led automation effort that reduced infrastructure provisioning processes by at least 50-75%.
- Developed and deployed research systems accounting system that eliminated data entry errors.
* Migrated our JupyterHub deployment from a bespoke manual process to an automated process using Kubernetes.  This reduced support time from over 100 hours to less than 5 per term for 200+ students. 
* Obtained $250K in research grant funding to modernize GPU computing resources for remote sensing analyses.

### Research Physical Scientist   
Cold Regions Research and Engineering Lab
September 2010 - April 2019
* Grew team from 0 to 6 while growing our proposal-driven research portfolio to $1.5M (annual budget). 
* Led and coached team in agile methodologies leading to a productivity increase from 1 to 6 publications in one year.
* Led development of a discrete element method software package (contributed over 80% in 30K lines of code).
